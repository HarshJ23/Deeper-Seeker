# Deeper Seeker

## Overview
The **Deeper seeker** is a simpler OSS version of Deep Research launched by OpenAI. It is a tool designed to perform comprehensive market research, competitor analysis, and investment memo preparation. 

The tool is built to:
- Conduct iterative research with continuous refinement.
- Generate structured search queries and analyze results.
- Produce well-formatted, actionable reports tailored to user queries.

## Key Features
1. **Iterative Research Workflow:**
   - Plans research steps based on user queries.
   - Generates precise search queries using the Exa API.
   - Continuously refines research based on findings.

2. **Structured Output:**
   - Produces JSON-structured search queries for API calls.
   - Formats search results with highlights, citations, and summaries.

3. **Comprehensive Reporting:**
   - Synthesizes research findings into actionable reports.
   - Includes reasoning, plans, and link counts for transparency.

4. **Customizable Queries:**
   - Handles simple to complex research tasks, including:
     - Market research and sizing.
     - Competitor analysis.
     - Investment memo preparation.

---

## How It Works
1. **User Query:**
   - The user provides a research query (e.g., "Analyze the global EV market in 2024").

2. **Research Planning:**
   - The AI creates a research plan, including reasoning and search queries.

3. **Search Execution:**
   - The tool uses the Exa API to search the web for relevant information.

4. **Result Processing:**
   - Search results are processed, formatted, and analyzed.

5. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - The AI evaluates the results, refines the plan, and performs additional searches if needed.

6. **Final Report:**
   - All findings are synthesized into a comprehensive, well-formatted report.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-research-assistant.git
   cd deep-research-assistant
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file and add your API keys:
     ```
     EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```

---

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Enter your research query when prompted:
   ```
   Enter your query: Analyze the competitive landscape of the cloud computing industry.
   ```

3. View the research process and final report:
   - The tool will display reasoning, plans, search results, and link counts for each iteration.
   - The final report will be printed in the console.
